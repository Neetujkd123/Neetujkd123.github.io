This resume, coverletter and references template is based on a LaTeX template[1] which had been heavily altered. I found myself fighting with the LaTeX styles too much and wished i could just use html to build my resume.

I originally created these templates to use with Prince[2] but viewing from a browser and printing should give you a nice result too.

Prince is an amazing tool that converts html to PDFs. Since my goal is a printed PDF, I wasn't too conernced with how clean my html or css is, however, you may want to contribute and help refine it.

Prince puts a watermark on the top right corner of the first page if you do not have a license. This watermark is non-printing, so print to PDF may be helpful to you (hint hint).

Sample Prince Usage (inside the samples directory)

    [path]/prince -v -ihtml resume.html -o resume.pdf
    [path]/prince -v -ihtml coverletter.html -o coverletter.pdf
